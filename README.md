# Indonesia Rainfall Trend 2020
I am a Data Analyst who gets a client who is one of the largest event organizers in Indonesia. The client wants to hold the biggest outdoor music concert in all of Indonesia on 2021. The concert cannot be held if the rainfall is very high because it can reduce the number of audience and damage some properties and sounds. The client asked for my help to analyze the regions in Indonesia with low rainfall and relatively sunny throughout 2020. I was asked to use statistics and data visualization dashboards to help them solve the problem.


This project aims to predict the price of rides on the ride-hailing platform of the company Uber &amp; Lyft in Boston, so we can know the price if we want to go to somewhere based on distance, hour, day, temperature, name (Uber or Lyft) and cab type.
