# Indonesia Rainfall Trend 2020
I am a Data Analyst who gets a client who is one of the largest event organizers in Indonesia. The client wants to hold the biggest outdoor music concert in all of Indonesia on 2021. The concert cannot be held if the rainfall is very high because it can reduce the number of audience and damage some properties and sounds. The client asked for my help to analyze the regions in Indonesia with low rainfall and relatively sunny throughout 2020. I was asked to use statistics and data visualization dashboards to help them solve the problem.


The objectives of this analysis are to:

- Know the average rainfall in Indonesia throughout 2020 based on month and province.
- Knowing the provinces and cities with the highest and lowest rainfall in Indonesia throughout 2020.
- Knowing the time trend of the highest and lowest rainfall in Indonesia throughout 2020 by city.
- Knowing the correlation of parameters that cause high or low rainfall.
- Identify the unique characteristics of certain provinces, such as in West Sumatra, and analyze the impact of outliers on the data.
- Conduct statistical tests to compare the average rainfall in a particular province, with rainfall in other provinces.
- Calculating the convidence interval of rainfall to estimate rainfall.
- Knowing the assumption of average rainfall in West Sumatra compared to all provinces using hypothesis testing method.
- Provide insight to the client based on the results of the analysis for decision making on event procurement.
